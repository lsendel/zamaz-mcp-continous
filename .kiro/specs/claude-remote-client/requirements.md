# Requirements Document - MVP

## Introduction

The Claude Remote Client MVP is a focused Python application that solves the core problem: enabling remote interaction with Claude AI across multiple project directories through Slack. The MVP delivers immediate value by providing project-aware Claude conversations via Slack while establishing a foundation for future intelligent features.

The system focuses on three core capabilities: (1) seamless project switching through simple commands, (2) context-aware Claude conversations that understand which project you're working on, and (3) basic task queuing for automated maintenance. This MVP can be built quickly, provides immediate utility, and creates the architecture foundation for evolving into a more sophisticated AI development assistant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Project and Session Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple Claude sessions and projects through special commands, so that I can work efficiently across different codebases while preserving each session's state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type `@@projects` in Slack THEN the system SHALL show me a list of my configured project directories
2. WHEN I type `@@switch <project>` THEN the system SHALL switch to that project and start a new Claude session in that directory
3. WHEN I type `@@new <project>` THEN the system SHALL create a new parallel Claude session for that project
4. WHEN I type `@@sessions` THEN the system SHALL show me all active Claude sessions with their project contexts
5. WHEN I type `@@quit` or `@@q` THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate the current Claude session
6. WHEN I switch between sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve each session's state, history, and context
7. WHEN multiple sessions are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which session I'm currently interacting with

### Requirement 2: Complete Claude CLI Integration with Command Routing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want full access to Claude's interactive mode, slash commands, and all CLI features through Slack, so that I get the complete Claude development experience remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a regular message in Slack THEN the system SHALL forward it to Claude's interactive mode maintaining all context
2. WHEN I send a message starting with `@@` THEN the system SHALL interpret it as a client management command
3. WHEN I use Claude's slash commands (`/help`, `/exit`, `/clear`, `/save`, etc.) THEN the system SHALL execute them in the Claude session and relay results to Slack
4. WHEN Claude shows interactive prompts or confirmations THEN the system SHALL present them in Slack and wait for responses
5. WHEN Claude displays streaming responses THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates in Slack
6. WHEN Claude uses the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag THEN the system SHALL have full file system access for development operations
7. WHEN Claude maintains conversation history THEN the system SHALL preserve all session state across the Slack bridge

### Requirement 3: Basic Task Queue

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to queue simple maintenance tasks that run automatically, so that routine work happens without my direct involvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a task to the queue THEN the system SHALL store it with the target project
2. WHEN tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL execute them in order during idle time
3. WHEN a task completes THEN the system SHALL notify me in Slack with the results
4. WHEN tasks fail THEN the system SHALL report the error and stop processing that queue
5. WHEN I check the queue THEN the system SHALL show me pending and completed tasks

### Requirement 4: Smart Architecture with Evolution Path

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system built with a smart architecture that starts simple but can evolve into a proper MCP integration, so that I get immediate value with a path to advanced capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MVP is built THEN it SHALL use Python 3.9+ with subprocess calls to Claude CLI for rapid development
2. WHEN integrating with Slack THEN it SHALL use the official slack-sdk library with async/await patterns
3. WHEN calling Claude THEN it SHALL use subprocess with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` but architect the interface to support future MCP conversion
4. WHEN the system evolves THEN it SHALL be designed to easily convert from subprocess to MCP server architecture
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL be installable via pip and provide both CLI and potential MCP server modes

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple configuration, so that I can get the system running quickly without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first run the system THEN it SHALL prompt me for Slack token and channel configuration
2. WHEN I configure projects THEN it SHALL let me specify project directories in a simple config file
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate that Claude CLI is available and working
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and setup guidance
5. WHEN everything is configured THEN it SHALL connect to Slack and announce it's ready

### Requirement 6: Advanced Claude CLI Features Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access Claude's advanced features like hooks, MCP integration, slash commands, and terminal configuration through Slack, so that I can leverage the full power of Claude's development capabilities remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude hooks are configured THEN the system SHALL execute them automatically and report results to Slack
2. WHEN Claude uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations THEN the system SHALL maintain these connections and relay MCP interactions through Slack
3. WHEN Claude's terminal configuration is customized THEN the system SHALL respect these settings in the remote session
4. WHEN I use Claude's slash commands (`/help`, `/exit`, `/clear`, `/save`, `/files`, etc.) THEN the system SHALL execute them and relay results to Slack
5. WHEN Claude performs file operations THEN the system SHALL handle file reading, writing, and project navigation seamlessly
6. WHEN Claude shows progress indicators or multi-step operations THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates in Slack
7. WHEN Claude requires user confirmation for dangerous operations THEN the system SHALL prompt through Slack and wait for explicit approval
##
# Requirement 7: Future MCP Evolution Path

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system designed to evolve into a proper MCP server, so that I can eventually have native Claude integration while starting with a working MVP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system architecture is designed THEN it SHALL separate the Slack interface from the Claude communication layer
2. WHEN the MVP is complete THEN it SHALL be straightforward to replace the subprocess layer with MCP protocol implementation
3. WHEN MCP evolution happens THEN the system SHALL become a proper MCP server that Claude can connect to natively
4. WHEN running as MCP server THEN it SHALL provide tools for project management, session handling, and Slack integration
5. WHEN both modes are supported THEN users SHALL be able to choose between subprocess (simple) and MCP (advanced) modes
